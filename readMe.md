This is the static scheduling code I implemented. Although static scheduling is the easiest way of parallelizing an input in this case it had
the worst results in terms of speed performance and it was juuuust slightly better than the serial algorithm. The reason for this is the fact that
in the file lines hadn't the same number of simplifications.
